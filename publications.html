            [The exuberance among the Congress party’s supporters has much to do with the baseline expectation, which had plummeted after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s thumping victory in December 2023 assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan. Despite an increase in seat count and vote share, the party continues to face significant structural challenges such as a very narrow social base. A detailed analysis of constituency-level data indicates that the party continues to lag behind in a head-to-head contest against the BJP , and its improved performance is largely in states where the party was a junior partner in the alliance.]

        Pratikshit, P., & Verma, R. (Upcoming). Do Incumbents and Opposition Strategize Mobilization Differently? 
        A Multi-Method Analysis of Political Rallies in India.

            [How can researchers distinguish between strategic intent and structural constraint when
studying campaign mobilization? We address this problem by taking up the case of
political rallies in India, a campaign tool widely deployed strategically but rarely examined, at a fine-grained scale. Our substantive question asks whether incumbents and
opposition parties follow different mobilization strategies in rally placement.
            
Our methodological contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a new dataset of
assembly-constituency–level rally placements in India of Narendra Modi and Rahul
Gandhi for the years 2019 and 2024. We constructed this dataset from scratch by
collaborating with news agencies, geocoding, scraping, and validating reports of campaign events during the 2024 General Elections. This dataset allows us to move beyond
the parliamentary constituency scale and investigate whether rallies cluster in boundary constituencies, strongholds, or swing seats. In addition to the location, it also helps
us analyze the timing of these rallies given the staggered nature of Indian elections
conducted in many stages. Second, and more importantly, we develop a multi-method
framework that integrates quantitative modeling with qualitative validation. We use
decision-tree classifiers to identify non-linear combinations of factors, such as competi-
tiveness, incumbency status, candidate wealth, and demographic composition, that best
predict rally location and timing. We then juxtapose these patterns against interviews
with party leaders and strategists that we have already begun, and we gauge whether
the statistical regularities align with the logics they themselves describe.

            More broadly, the paper will demonstrate how combining novel datasets, machine-
learning classifiers, and qualitative interviews can refine inferences about campaign
strategies in weakly institutionalized democracies. The dataset will also provide a
starting point for other scholars studying mobilization, who can extend it by adding
secondary leaders to examine whether the placement of rallies by top leaders differs from
that of others. We propose this framework as a replicable, methodological template for
testing the validity of observational findings and for preventing over-interpretation of
correlations as intentional strategy.]

        Pratikshit, P. (Upcoming). The Myth of Discipline — A Behavioral Analysis of the BJP’s Changing Organization.
        <br>

        <p id="abs4" class="abstract" style="display: none;">
            [A dominant narrative in the study of Indian politics characterizes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a highly disciplined organization. This paper challenges that view, arguing that internal discipline is conditional rather than absolute. I develop a formal model of party adherence that distinguishes between electoral and non-electoral directives. The model posits that a member's utility for complying with a directive is a function of material incentives, disciplinary pressure, and the cognitive dissonance incurred when a directive conflicts with personal beliefs. I theorize that the weight of these factors shifts across the party hierarchy and by directive type. For electoral directives, the utility of compliance is high and consistent across levels due to clear material stakes and minimal dissonance. For non-electoral directives, however, the utility calculus diverges: lower-level members face high cognitive costs with few compensating material rewards, making adherence less likely.

I test this model with original survey data of BJP members in Madhya Pradesh, analyzing adherence to a post-election directive to downplay the role of a popular cash-transfer scheme in the party's victory. Quantitative analysis confirms the model's predictions: while top- and mid-level members largely followed the directive, lower-level members were significantly more likely to dissent. The findings demonstrate that the BJP’s famed discipline is a stratified phenomenon, robust on electoral issues but fragmented on non-electoral ones. This conditional theory of party discipline offers a framework for comparative analysis of hierarchical organizations beyond the Indian case.]

        Pratikshit, P. (Upcoming). Segment Pivotality Index: A Meso-Level Diagnostic for Election Irregularities in India

        <p id="abs5" class="abstract" style="display: none;">
            [Most election-forensics tools assume precinct-level data and two-party competition, making them unsuitable for India, where timely results are available only at the assembly-segment level (meso-level) and where electoral dynamics are highly. Using data from the 2019 and 2024 general elections, this paper shows that two widely used methods, the second-digit Benford’s Law test and the unimodality test, break down when applied to meso-level units, either because sample sizes are too small or because their assumptions do not hold. Simulations of honest elections further confirm that these failures are structural rather than evidence of manipulation. To address this limitation, I introduce the Segment Pivotality Index (SPI), a non-parametric diagnostic that measures how much each assembly segment contributes to the overall parliamentary margin. When applied to both election cycles, SPI gives stable and interpretable patterns and provides a way to identify constituencies where irregularities, if present, would be most consequential in data-scarce environments.]
