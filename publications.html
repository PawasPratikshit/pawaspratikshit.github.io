            [The exuberance among the Congress party’s supporters has much to do with the baseline expectation, which had plummeted after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s thumping victory in December 2023 assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan. Despite an increase in seat count and vote share, the party continues to face significant structural challenges such as a very narrow social base. A detailed analysis of constituency-level data indicates that the party continues to lag behind in a head-to-head contest against the BJP , and its improved performance is largely in states where the party was a junior partner in the alliance.]

            [A dominant narrative in the study of Indian politics characterizes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a highly disciplined organization. This paper challenges that view, arguing that internal discipline is conditional rather than absolute. I develop a formal model of party adherence that distinguishes between electoral and non-electoral directives. The model posits that a member's utility for complying with a directive is a function of material incentives, disciplinary pressure, and the cognitive dissonance incurred when a directive conflicts with personal beliefs. I theorize that the weight of these factors shifts across the party hierarchy and by directive type. For electoral directives, the utility of compliance is high and consistent across levels due to clear material stakes and minimal dissonance. For non-electoral directives, however, the utility calculus diverges: lower-level members face high cognitive costs with few compensating material rewards, making adherence less likely.

I test this model with original survey data of BJP members in Madhya Pradesh, analyzing adherence to a post-election directive to downplay the role of a popular cash-transfer scheme in the party's victory. Quantitative analysis confirms the model's predictions: while top- and mid-level members largely followed the directive, lower-level members were significantly more likely to dissent. The findings demonstrate that the BJP’s famed discipline is a stratified phenomenon, robust on electoral issues but fragmented on non-electoral ones. This conditional theory of party discipline offers a framework for comparative analysis of hierarchical organizations beyond the Indian case.]

        Pratikshit, P. (Upcoming). Measuring Constituency Pivotality: A Generalizable Index for Electoral Integrity Monitoring
        <br>

        <p id="abs5" class="abstract" style="display: none;">
            [This paper introduces the *Segment Pivotality Index* (SPI), a new measure that identifies how individual Assembly Constituencies (ACs) shape parliamentary outcomes in India’s national elections. The SPI captures an AC’s decisiveness within its Parliamentary Constituency (PC) by comparing the parliamentary winner’s and runner-up’s votes in that segment relative to the overall PC margin when the segment is excluded. This approach fills a key empirical gap in the study of electoral manipulation: the absence of reliable micro-level data on counting and aggregation processes. Using meso-level AC data from the 2019 and 2024 general elections, combined with demographic and spatial information, the paper demonstrates how the SPI can reveal localized patterns of incumbent advantage. Statistical analyses show that segments with high SPI values are disproportionately concentrated in constituencies won by the national incumbent and display irregular turnout and vote-share distributions, consistent with targeted mobilization or manipulation. By enabling the detection of pivotal electoral geographies without relying on inaccessible micro-data, the SPI offers a new methodological framework for studying electoral integrity in large democracies. Conceptually, it bridges the gap between aggregate electoral analysis and micro-forensic approaches, providing a scalable tool to examine how local advantage translates into national success.]
